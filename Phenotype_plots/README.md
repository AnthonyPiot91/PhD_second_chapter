# The effects of a disruptive variant on wood property traits

For one genetic variant, we want to plot phenotypic measurments for 17 wood
property traits in function of three possible genotypes, homozygous for the
reference allele, heterozygous, and homozygous for the alternative allele
(a.k.a the genetic variant).
For this, we will merge the phenotypic and genotypic data.
Then, perform linear regression models.
And finally, plot the results.
