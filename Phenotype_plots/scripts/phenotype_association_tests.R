                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## Create a new table by merging the phenotype and genotype tables

# The match function is used
# It is better to use column names (strings) instead of column numbers
# (integers) when subsetting for improved code readibility
phenotype_table$genotype <- genotype_table[match(phenotype_table$IDs, 
                                                 genotype_table$Id), "Genotype"]

# Then we need to remove the NA values (those for which no match in
# genotype_table was found)
phenotype_table <- phenotype_table[!is.na(phenotype_table$genotype), ]

# Replacing the contents of the genotype column with the relevant genotype
# information only
# sapply is a version of lapply that simplifies the output into a vector of the 
# appropriate type (when applicable) 
# Here I am using `[` as a 
# function to extract the first element of each vector returned by strsplit
phenotype_table$genotype <- sapply(strsplit(phenotype_table$genotype, ":"),

# When computational efficiency is not a concern (like here), avoid relying on 
# external packages

# It it prefereable to use the same object name throughout the analysis; 
# this may or may not be desirable if the original data.frame need to be 
# accessed later in the analysis.
# However, this is not the case here, therefore doing so reduces the number of 
# distinct objects created

# Reorganize columns
# No need to use cbind when reordering columns; you can simply use the order of 
# column indices.
# Here is one case where  using integer column indices is recommended; 
# it's much easier than writing out names

# The lapply function is used to iterate over all values in a list
# Its first argument is a list:
#  Here we can pass a data.frame because a data.frame is actually a list
# Its second argument is a function that will be applied to each element of the 
# list:
#  The function can be defined beforehand and its name written out.
#  Here, an anonymous function is used instead, and defined directly inside the 
#  function call
#  Additional arguments to the function (here, the genotype data) are passed as 
#  additional arguments to lapply

# The value returned is a list with one element per element in the original list
# Here, regressions is therefore a list of regression results, with names 
# matching those of the original columns
# Assigning such intermediate results inside a list is a better approach than
# using "assign" because it stores the results together and does not clutter the
# global environment; all regressions can be accessed from within a single list;
# it also avoids having to access the objects using "eval"

# Here a for loop is used to generate the plot
# However, the results will still be assigned into a list as lapply would have 
# done
plots <- list()

# We iterate over the phenotype names, which can be used to access data columns,
# regression results, and to assign elements in the "plots" list
